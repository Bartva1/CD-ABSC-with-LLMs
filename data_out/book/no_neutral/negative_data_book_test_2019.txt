jack
-1
some of the $T$ seemed unnecessary, and should have been severely cropped by a ruthless editor: the love affair between the crippled wwi survivor "mac" mcfadden, barber to the politically great and one of guy's information sources, and carol, a housemaid and part-time prostitute; and between bournemouth postmistress sue graham and army sergeant jerry white - though the experiences of the latter did usefully tie the norway debacle into the storyline on a personal level

double romance
-1
the basic plot goes thus: $T$ is sent to berlin on an undercover covert operation to trap an evil traffiker in both drugs and humans
carol jordan
-1
although i liked the concept of this book, i found arthur's overall journey to be a bit too contrived and that he is led where he goes simply because the $T$ placed him on that path and not because it was the pull of the character leading us on his story
author
-1
this is a $T$ packed with adventure
suspenseful story

the story is basically a double $T$ but zindel has too much of a grip on the ugliness of life to describe the book as 'romantic

$T$ is a fantasy novel to the extreme, with many of the cliches that go along with the distinction
mister monday
-1
also in the story angela and $T$ oops
diabola
-1
i would recommed this book for $T$
ages 11 and up
1
the $T$, both in frog and human form, is wonderfully quirky and cranky, and even mister monday turns out not to be irredeemable

these creatures, called fetchers bring a terrible disease called the "$T$", which after afew symtoms like having a cold, puts the infected people to sleep- literally- they fall asleep, and can't be woken up! aurther is particually sensitive to this outbreak beacuse he is adopted{his birth parents died in a flu outbreak when he was a baby}

hitler
-1
as you're reading, you will probably find yourself wondering just how $T$ is going to tie up such apparently disparate elements into a cohesive story, and to what ultimate end
marshall
-1
but the biggest problem with the last temptation is that mcdermid tries too hard to force a particular $T$
ending
-1
arthur penhaligon and suzy blue are two amazing characters, $T$: a normal boy, asthmatic, not too confident about himself, intelligent and thoughtful
arthur
1
as if that were not enough, $T$ pursue him
dog-faced fetchers
-1
arthur has to go to a $T$ and defeat an enemy that has so much more power than he does, if monday was a t-rex then arthur would be a blade of grass compared to him

unlike other such authors, who place their heroes in a medieval realm of magical swords, horse-back riding and dragons, $T$ follows the example of writers such as philip pullman, susanna clarke and (to a lesser degree) j

in spite of the cover shot, this book is not $T$
anti-marriage
-1
arthur has to go to a foreign realm and defeat an enemy that has so much more power than he does, if monday was a t-rex then $T$ would be a blade of grass compared to him
arthur

however, i did feel one particular scene might be rather nightmare-inducing for the youngest readers - so recommend this for the $T$
ages of 12 and above
1
he went into the library and tuoched the $T$ with the atlas and the atlas turned huge and had a picture of a house

-1
the book also discusses $T$, and of great concern to me these days, what women and men are doing about the name problem

$T$ handles her large cast of characters and a complex plot adroitly

the author seems to have tried out several different settings (victorian policemen and a sort of bob cratchit universe, along with $T$, good and bad angels, and a really stinky and terrifying roman bathhouse), then didn't want to discard anything
dinosaurs
-1
i recommend this $T$ to anyone and everyone
book
1
overall, despite the quirky environment and characters, the $T$ felt predictable and a bit templated in its structure
story
-1
the $T$ starts getting really fun at this point
book
1
the main character arthur has just moved to a new school (typical of children's books) and is plagued with $T$

$T$ is put through a rigorous test of bravery and compassion to face the evil mister monday
arthur
-1
young adult readers may be slightly confused by all the twists and machinations, but will still be thrilled by the adventures of arthur and his friend suzy turquoise blue as they negotiate the secrets of the $T$, guided by the will, and armed with nothing but the key, a great deal of common sense, and a very strong will to survive
house
-1
the noir style of writing in $T$'s portions of the narrative are wonderful and cleverly hard-boiled
jack
-1
the $T$ is a depressing let-down
ending

not only is the meaning of wife jam packed with original $T$, it also jellies over with meaning! i can't tell you how many times i have pulled this book back off the shelf since placing it there a few weeks ago upon finishing it

great architect
-1
in total, i found this $T$ to be more than adequate
book
1
still, $T$ is a terrific writer of prose, one of the best out there in genre fiction
smith
1
her psychological material is carefully researched and propels the $T$ along at a brisk pace
plot
1
this is a great opening for chess improvisors and $T$  out here in sub-master land that like to mix it up
tacticians
1
as such, the $T$ nit about the psychologists getting killed seems underdeveloped and at times just incidental
serial killer
-1
deliberately author $T$ splits up his story between the first person narration of ex-cop/coffee table book captionist jack whelan, with a variety of third person accounts that are purposely confusing and disparate, so that you need a second reading to be able to piece it all together properly
michael marshall
-1
both the complexity of the plot and the at times $T$ may keep this from being a book for fifth grade and under, unless a child in these years is looking to be challenged and a little frightened
nightmare-like imagery
-1
i did not enjoy this $T$ very much at all
book
-1
arthur is suspended between many betrayals, and has many things like "trust the will" and then "don't trust the will" told to him, and is constantly hunted by the lazy mister monday and his noon (right hand man), $T$ (left hand woman) and constantly helped by mondays dusk, the final of the trio of the day (you may have guessed mister monday can only come to earth on monday, his dawn can only come from 12:01 am-1:00 am, noon can only come from 12:00 pm-1:00 pm, and finaly dusk can come from 11:00 pm-12:00 am)

arthur with the lesser key to the lower kingdom of the $T$ in hand, must travel into the house to find a cure for the mysterious plague that is striking the people of his town and his loved ones and find out why there are beings intent on getting the key from him, even if it means killing him
house
-1
i'd certainly stress this advice to any prospective readers:  if you like impossible, anything-goes $T$, this may be up your alley; but if you are looking for a serious mystery, with intellectual quality and complex, non-stereotypical characters, pass this one by
sci-fi
1
i kept skimming and skimming, thinking with my fingers crossed that "this will all make sense later, i'm sure," but eventually i got at least a glimmer of a storyline involving a young nine year old girl who at first seems like she's been kidnapped by an evil, foul smelling man, but within a few pages we find out that this "abduction" is not really what it seems and the the 9 year old, cute little $T$, exhibits the cold, maniacal soullessness of an adult, and an especially demented one at that

while nix creates some unique $T$ and a fairly interesting hierarchy within the house, it falls flat on its face because the characters are underutilized and not given enough time and attention to mature

leaf
-1
$T$ seeks safety within the walls of a house that only he can see
arthur
-1
it's a story about adventure, but also about responsibility, and courage, and overall i could recommend it to any boy or $T$, and their parents, to read it!
girl
1
but the intruders is pretty much a middling effort, at least when it comes to the $T$
plot
-1
i couldn't get past the fact that it all was so contrived, with the profiler magically pulling predictions about the $T$ out of thin air
criminal
-1
i was hooked!!<br>garth nix is a awesome writer and though the book is a little babyish - its definetly worth a read!<br>i thought the whole minute - hand - is - a - key part was a real good idea plus the names are so fun!<br>the only thing i didn't like was that arthur doesen't take his rightful place as "$T$"

book
-1

liz is a little more outgoing and popular, who sets $T$ up on a double date with her and sean

plotline
-1
unlikeable, dour and sour $T$ populate this novel that has scifi/horror overtones set in something of a hardboiled mystery

arthur
-1

arthur
-1
too many characters and $T$ leave the reader wondering who is who and what is going on
plot twists
-1
my only comments are "do we really need the ed and leaf characters?" and "why's the guy in ancient greece speaking english?"  ed and leaf may be useful throughout later books in the series, but the $T$ seems to have been a boo-boo
greek guy

recommended for all people young and old who love $T$

two of nicky's friends come by to visit $T$ and the kittens, wishing that they themselves had a kitten
mog
-1
his $T$ carries over and you can pinpoint many similarties with this book and his other works
story structure
1
i had read some mms here and there; just not really getting into any particular piece, but this $T$ had me spellbound!
book
1
this book explores the manner in which $T$ - well british anyway - people became familiar with india from the 1700s on
european
-1
the endless game is the first of a $T$ (the second is:  a spy at twilight) in the vein of the le carre "karla" quartet
two-book series
-1
while paul zindel's $T$ of four teenagers and their relationship problems is at times both moving and perfectly toned, mostly the problems presented in it are as dated as they come
classic tale
-1
the $T$ was only moderately likable with a barely intact sense of humor
main character
-1
val mcdermid continues her 'hill and jordan' series with an entertaining $T$ that combines a dangerous undercover assignment with an investigation of a serial killer, each of which leaves tony and carol on the verge of death!
story
1
however, i think the recommended $T$is a little off
age range (4-6)
-1
as for the 'bad guys', the smuggler tadeusz and his $T$ krazic, are suitably creepy, although the scenes featuring just the two of them are a bit slow
crony
-1
this was due to a sadistic teacher who forced him to run a cross-country course, resulting in a near death experience, during which he encountered the unlikely duo of sneezer and $T$
mister monday
-1
arthur is suspended between many betrayals, and has many things like "trust the will" and then "don't trust the will" told to him, and is constantly hunted by the lazy mister monday and his $T$ (right hand man), dawn (left hand woman) and constantly helped by mondays dusk, the final of the trio of the day (you may have guessed mister monday can only come to earth on monday, his dawn can only come from 12:01 am-1:00 am, noon can only come from 12:00 pm-1:00 pm, and finaly dusk can come from 11:00 pm-12:00 am)
noon
-1
the main characters are two twin girls, angela and $T$
diabola
-1
then there was a big fire that $T$ started trying to get the key
noon
-1
instead she is sent into deep undercover to bring down a notorious criminal named $T$ and his right hand man darko krasic, who are based in germany
tadeusz radecki
-1
their $T$ had always been able to handle the girls, both the good and the bad, until one day when diabola does something that neither her parents nor her sister would ever imagine
parents
-1
and yet, that aside, $T$ captivated me from the first horrifying chapter -- so much so, that i read it all in one night
the intruders
1
so i would say that if you are willing to compose a story to go along with the pictures you can use this book to successfully teach your children about $T$
relative size
-1
$T$ does not know the danger ahead of him untill the night somebody shows up at his window
arthur
-1
<br>             i really liked this $T$ and would recommend it to anyone who likes books about the good and the dark side of life
book
1
the unraveling of the $T$ was brought about by a mistake that i found completely innane
cover
-1
at the same time, carol jordan, a very ambitious dci and the love of hill's life, is offered any position she wants if she does her superiors a "favor" --- seduce $T$ into a sting that will expose his drug, arms and people smuggling businesses
tadeusz radecki

sleepy plague
-1
garth nix's "$T$" begins a brand new fantasy series in the "keys to the kingdom" series
mister monday
-1
this is a must-read for all, whether you're a $T$ or a non-wife!
wife
1
the whole $T$ feels a bit contrived
book
-1
one $T$ is worth several dozen greg ileses, a bushel of patricia cornwalls, a thousand gregggg hurwitzes, a million dean koontzes and a number that defies notation of the mind blastingly insipid kyle mills
marshall
1
i am sure paul zindel means well, but his outlook on $T$ is simplistic at best and cynical at worst
human life
-1
<br>     but with this key comes strange creatures from another dimension who pursue the key, and though he doesn't know why, $T$ knows that he shouldn't give it to them{they work for mister monday- who wants the key back}
aurther
-1
in having this attach arthur penhaligon meets two new friends (leaf and ed twin brother and sister) and also gets a suprise, $T$ and his buttler, sneezer, appear with a flash of light and give arthur a gift,(arthur thinks sneezer is up to something but does not know) a minute hand of a clock (the clock that was guarding the will) and a book (an atlas he can't yet open)
mister monday
-1
noon with his big flame sword and arthur with his $T$
clock sword
-1
in the house, arthur encounters $T$, a cheeky cockney girl from the 17th century of his own world and one of the "piper's children"; the personified will itself in the form of a tiny frog with a penchant for jumping down people's throats; the "old one," whose identity should be obvious to anyone with an interest in classical mythology, and assorted other denizens
suzy turquoise blue
-1
i would give it 30 thumbs up if i could! this book starts off with the main character, $T$, going to a new school
arthur
-1
this australian author is fast-becoming one of the biggest names in fantasy with his reinvention of the genre and his intricate, fascinating $T$
plots
1
if you're paranoid at all, you're going to get your instincts jumpstarted within a few pages of reading $T$
the intruders
-1
marshall makes you read through to the end but you'll be scratching your head over many of his plot choices, and i can't make up my mind whether the $T$ is actually crazy stupid, or maybe too smart for a moron like myself
story
-1
$T$ is the kind of book that pulls you in after the first page and pulls you to the end
mister monday
-1
angela always want to be with be with her sister $T$
diabla
-1
i found this book (especially the $T$) more bizarre than either sabriel or lirael, but every bit as engrossing
prologue
1
arthur's immediately visited by the sleepy mister monday and his butler sneezer, and is given a key in the shape of a $T$
clock hand
-1
here he must reclaim the house from the sinister morrow days mister monday, grim tuesday, $T$, sir thursday, lady friday, supirior saturday, and lord sunday
drowned wednesday
-1
after that, $T$ ( one of mister
noon
-1
aurther has heavy $T$, which places him in the hospital quite often
asthma
-1
in novel after novel, from only forward to blood of angels and now to the intruders, he is able to deftly create sharply incisive and deeply observed $T$ inside the first page and sustain that sense of compassion and understanding throughout the work, no matter the form within which he is working, no matter the subject
characters
1
i picked this book up in bangkok as i was browsing through a second hand book store, and didn't expect much until i read that this was a novel by the $T$ who wrote house of cards, to play the king and the final cut
guy
1
cuthbert is expecting a child, but has $T$
twins
-1
$T$ may be slightly confused by all the twists and machinations, but will still be thrilled by the adventures of arthur and his friend suzy turquoise blue as they negotiate the secrets of the house, guided by the will, and armed with nothing but the key, a great deal of common sense, and a very strong will to survive
young adult readers
-1
nix delights in playing with words and concepts, and the phases "got a frog in your throat" and "having a silver tongue" take on whole new meaning here, and things such as books, paper, the written word and language are given a solid, tangible $T$ here that is thought-provoking and completely original
quality
1
also, $T$ sprinkles little hints and clues to the next books throughout the text, so read carefully!
nix
-1
the first half of this novel is certainly well written, but the $T$ is disjointed and makes little sense
plotline
-1
i have read and used this $T$ many, many times
book
1
do their parents understand or even care about them?  are they ready for sex?  meanwhile can maggie and $T$ learn to communicate enough to stay together?
dennis
-1
at the same time, we have the bloodwinged, silver-tongued noon and the ugly $T$, not to mention the hideous nithlings
fetchers
-1
i found "skylar" to be a better book, because the $T$ was more original
story
1
she'd like to, but she worries that it might end up in $T$
pregnancy
-1
another book by garth nix that changes the name of reading entirely! i've read the entire seventh tower series which was one big thriller, but $T$ is so compelling you can't put it down
mister monday
1
and at school, some dog faced men come in to kill him along with noon for the key, so arthur couldn't be master of the lower house if he could get the $T$ from monday inside the strange house
hour hand key
-1
considering my taste in literature, $T$'s books should fit perfectly with my preferences, but something about them just falls short
nix
-1
both of them work with local cops, jordan with $T$ in germany, and hill with brigadier marijke van hasselt from holland
petra becker
-1
as an indian, this $T$ was revealing and awe-inspiring by the scope of the discoveries that it describes
book
1
<br>	the main characters in my darling my hamburger are two girls named $T$ and maggie
liz
-1
the $T$ was only mildly surprising, and so was how the killer  would get caught
killer
-1
i felt like liz was a friend of mine, kind of  like i was $T$
maggie
1
her chapter on $T$, for example, portrays women who just about break the law getting back at their ex-husbands
divorce
-1
the author explains the "$T$ industrial complex" that drives the image of the "perfect" wedding at the expense of all sensibilities

fantasy
-1
mister monday takes place on a monday(make sense) when arthur our "hero" happens to become the heir to a will that was divided a century or so ago by the "morrow days," which are the days of the week,a nd they operate in the "$T$" only on the day in which they are named
secondary realms

house

-1
based on historical fact, winston's war is a solid and absorbing fictional rendition of the leadership struggle between prime minister neville chamberlain and winston churchill between $T$ and may 10, 1940
october 1, 1938
-1
the arc of the stories is huge, but strongly anchored in the $T$ and nix's attention to details
characters
1
the $T$ suffers little from the amount of ideas and concepts that nix crams between its covers, which can seem either random or confusing to a first-time reader
book
-1
ernest gellner stigmatizes freudianism as a secular religion, where the unconscious (a new version of the original sin) is treated as a $T$, with a sharp distinction between the sacred (those under analysis) and the profane, between the good (the true believers) and the bad, and where reason must be suspended

children
1
i got "class trip" from a library for $T$
10 cents
-1
i enjoyed this $T$, but i think it was a bit confusing to follow
book
1
the writing also starts to improve with this book and the $T$, two female, european police officers who develop a long-term relationship with each other, are the best of any of the books

it's in the minor details with which dobbs fleshes out the story of $T$'s fall and the rise of his nemesis, churchill, to an epic 685 paper-backed pages (uk harpercollins edition)
chamberlain
-1
slightly more relevant, but still mildly tedious, was the dysfunctional relationship between brendan bracken, churchill's closest confidant, and $T$'s niece, anna fitzgerald
kennedy

soon arthur is being pursued by more dog-faced fetchers, and a strange plague is sweeping his town -- and somehow the key is keeping him alive, even though he was supposed to die of an $T$

how did the language of psychoanalysis become the dominant idiom in which the middle classes of the industrialized west speak about their emotions? ernest gellner offers a forceful and complex answer to this intriguing question in $T$
the psychoanalytic movement

1
he has recently branched out from his $T$ into people smuggling
drug distribution
-1
when i took the first look at the cover i  knew that it would be an wonderfull $T$
book
1
also it's cool that a tiny $T$ can turn a yiny atlas into a gigantic one

quirky $T$ is reminiscent of a lloyd alexander heroine, strong and brave and just a little strange
suzy
1
aurther, suzy blue{a friend he makes on the way} and the will now will go through many treacherous tasks to defeat monday- $T$ so that aurther can claim the key, therefore the first part of the will is done, aurther to find a cure to thing strange plauge, and suzy to help them all
the will
-1
kennedy; the alcoholic, disillusioned and psychologically tortured idealist, guy burgess (of burgess, philby, and maclean of cold war infamy); the stuttering king george vi, who whines that the german invasion of poland interrupted his grouse hunting; and the machiavellian newspaper mogul, $T$, lord beaverbrook

$T$ was an absolute marvel!

because the will tricked $T$ into giving the key to arthur, noon

but when they leave someone name mister monday comes, and gives arthur the $T$
key
-1
mcdermid does a pretty good job of integrating the $T$, and her use of german and dutch settings makes for a change from her usual 'real english locations with fictional names' approach
two subplots
1
it has many $T$ that are fascinating! great book, i will read it again and again
historical facts
1
$T$'s book is much more easily absorbed than  tseitlin & glaskov's, budapest for the tournament player, with its  head-spinning variations and transpositions
boryk
-1
$T$ describes how the market followed classical economic laws
levi
-1
angela and diabola is not only a good $T$ for girls, but also for boys with a good sense of imagination

1
but when the $T$ saw them he named them angela & diabola which  means angel & devil
vicar
-1
this $T$ is well written and extremely intrigueing,as i found; once i started it, i couldn't put it down! it rocks!garth nix has a way with words
book
1
he doesn't know why he was given this $T$, but it is the only thing keeping him alive
key
-1
whilst his classmates run for help, the strangest thing happens: a young man and his butler appear from nowhere, and bequeath to arthur something that they call a "key" (though to arthur it looks more like a large minute hand from a clock), and a strange book called `$T$'
the compleat atlas of the house and immediate environs
-1
this was not supposed to happen, the days were supposed to keep $T$ whole and pass it on to a rightful heir without conflict
the will
-1
in a chapter called "$T$," which is what i've always called "white lace dreams," she details the wedding dress selection and compares the white lacy dress to the wedding cake
heart of whiteness
-1
these creatures, called fetchers bring a terrible disease called the "$T$", which after afew symtoms like having a cold, puts the infected people to sleep- literally- they fall asleep, and can't be woken up! aurther is particually sensitive to this outbreak beacuse he is adopted{his birth parents died in a flu outbreak when he was a baby}
sleepy pluage
-1
this thought races through $T$'s mind as he saves the world in mister monday
arthur
-1
i liked it when dybo pushed  $T$ off the climbing frame without any clothes on! angela and diabola is a great book for all ages because it is not violent but it is extra funny
miss mursles
-1
the cast of characters in this sweeping story by michael dobbs of political maneuvering, skullduggery, and backstabbing is an historical who's who of the times: the ailing, haughty, and pacifist chamberlain, who personifies england's bitter memories of the $T$ and the popular concept of "never again"; the ambitious and self-absorbed churchill, whose pugnacity sometimes clouds prudence; the defeatist, philandering, and anti-semitic u

the will
-1
the generous side of $T$ is one that is less frequently discussed
capone
1
in this period of formula this and that, this $T$ was just strange enough to entertain and legitimate enough to engross
book
1
while this book explores $T$ i  highly recommend it to others
issues of teens
-1
i do have a suggestion; if you're a "happy" person and like to read "happy happy" books, $T$ is probably not for you
michael marshall
-1
cuthbertson-jones thinks diabola hurt the men for her, but really $T$ didn't like the men and had done it for herself
diabola
-1
this confusion is only helped by the fact that nix tends to rely on extremely vague $T$ of characters and environments that leave the reader wondering where the characters are and what they look like
descriptions
-1
i'd certainly stress this advice to any prospective readers:  if you like impossible, anything-goes sci-fi, this may be up your alley; but if you are looking for a serious mystery, with intellectual quality and complex, non-stereotypical $T$, pass this one by
characters
-1
the fourth psychological thriller from $T$ (writing under his truncated pseudonym) is a departure from his straw men universe

it all started when arthur penholgon was given a key and a $T$ from

chamberlain
-1
$T$ makes some interesting speculations upon the origins of the universe
nix
1
all these places are mentioned by $T$ (and, of course, many i have not visited) and i found it interesting to read about how each has a context in indian history and helps us to understand better this continent of enormous population, of refined culture, and of such diverse mixtures of race
mr keay
-1
not only is $T$ jam packed with original research, it also jellies over with meaning! i can't tell you how many times i have pulled this book back off the shelf since placing it there a few weeks ago upon finishing it
the meaning of wife
-1
a definite must-read for $T$ fans!
mcdermid
-1
nix also uses a fantasy theme that we have all seen in the movies: $T$
interdimensional travel
-1
i highly recommend this book to any $T$ that does not  know how to express the many things that they went through as a teenager to  their children
parent
1
the people that wouldn't like this would be $T$
boys
-1
the idea at its core is ancient and well trod ground; but here, miraculously, $T$ has brought forth new life upon it
michael marshall
-1
i like books with drama and $T$ that seem true, so i really liked this book
stories
1
aurther, suzy blue{a friend he makes on the way} and the will now will go through many treacherous tasks to defeat monday- the will so that aurther can claim the key, therefore the first part of the will is done, aurther to find a cure to thing strange plauge, and $T$ to help them all

after that $T$ starts acting even more diabolic

the book had a far-fetched premise, but once i was able to move past that detail, the $T$ was readable, albeit unrealistic
book
-1
quite possibly the best $T$ you'll ever read
biography
-1
while nicky and $T$ are sad at first, they both realize that it's what's best for all involved, and mog resumes sleeping with nicky again

1
everyone loves angela much and hate $T$
diabola
-1
the $T$ themselves are paper thin
characters
-1
<br>	i would definitely recommend this book to $T$
people in 6th-9th grade
1
$T$, a clinical psychologist who consults with the police as a profiler, and carol jordan, the police officer with whom he works most closely, always feel like real people with investigative abilities and compassion that are easy to admire and foibles that are easy to relate to
hill
1
the slow mating dance between $T$ and jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff
hill
-1
this was due to a sadistic teacher who forced him to run a cross-country course, resulting in a near death experience, during which he encountered the unlikely duo of $T$ and mister monday
sneezer
-1
$T$ stigmatizes freudianism as a secular religion, where the unconscious (a new version of the original sin) is treated as a revelation, with a sharp distinction between the sacred (those under analysis) and the profane, between the good (the true believers) and the bad, and where reason must be suspended
ernest gellner
-1
class see the creatures too, so $T$ apprehensively goes on his journey as the reluctant hero who is bound to find a way to save his community and family

$T$ makes you read through to the end but you'll be scratching your head over many of his plot choices, and i can't make up my mind whether the story is actually crazy stupid, or maybe too smart for a moron like myself

novel
1
this book had some mature subject matter that $T$ should not read
young kids
-1
i liked the way the author described all imnportant and  non-important characters in such detail, but i didn't like the way he kept coming back to the question "why did arthur get the key, why is he still alive, who are mister monday and $T$"
sneezer
-1
in this series starter, $T$ learns what power he has as he tries to determine how to live his life with this key that he has obtained and this house and little, scary fantasy creatures that no one else can see but him
arthur
-1
the novel creeps along at a good pace, and the whole time there lingers the mixing tastes of a $T$, a psychological thriller, and speculative fiction
crime novel
-1
ernest gellner stigmatizes $T$ as a secular religion, where the unconscious (a new version of the original sin) is treated as a revelation, with a sharp distinction between the sacred (those under analysis) and the profane, between the good (the true believers) and the bad, and where reason must be suspended
freudianism
-1
unfortunately the rest of the $T$ just felt like a bunch events related one after another, not unlike the bible
story
-1
this book is paul zindel's second and was first published way back in $T$
1969
-1
but even more important, as $T$ emphasizes, the fraud of freudianism is a typical example of the functioning of human society in general:
gellner
-1
$T$ is suspended between many betrayals, and has many things like "trust the will" and then "don't trust the will" told to him, and is constantly hunted by the lazy mister monday and his noon (right hand man), dawn (left hand woman) and constantly helped by mondays dusk, the final of the trio of the day (you may have guessed mister monday can only come to earth on monday, his dawn can only come from 12:01 am-1:00 am, noon can only come from 12:00 pm-1:00 pm, and finaly dusk can come from 11:00 pm-12:00 am)
arthur
-1
the $T$ were like one single person divided into two or  twins were one got all the good and the other got all the bad
twins
-1
at times violent, touching, and just plain creepy, $T$ is the kind of novel that causes your brain to twitch in confusing glee
